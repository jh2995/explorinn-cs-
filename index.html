  <h1>Brigadoon</h1>
   	<p>This musical came back to City center last year for four days I was lucky enough to have seen it. 
     Even though not many millennials have seen it is an. The movie and the show will provide one with a sense of 
     homeyness and the gracefulness of <b>Gene Kelly in his MGM musical</b>has been warming the hearts of everyone. 
     This timeless romantic classic brings the mystery and mage of the Scottish Highlands to life. 
     The story is about a  New Yorker, Tommy Albright he unexpectedly arrives at the mysterious <u>Scottish Highland

     Tommy meets and falls in love with Fiona, a beautiful villager.
